# Mathematica notebooks

Welcome to my Mathematica notebooks page.

The purpose of most notebooks is to reproduce results in theoretical astrophysics peer reviewed papers interactively.

If you have Mathematica software, you can open and run the .nb files. Note that these were made with Mathematica version 13.1.

Otherwise, the calculations can be viewed in the .pdf files.

## Tidal heating in detached double white dwarf binaries

Here are the notebooks used for the calculations and figures in McNeill and Hirai [2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21821) (accepted by ApJ)

- Figures 1 and 3 (MH25_ELM_WD_primary_figures_1_and_3)

- Figure 2 (MH25_Nmw_rates_figure_2)

- Figures 4 and 5 (MH25_Tidal_heating_models_figures_4_and_5)

In addition, there is a notebook demonstrating key concepts which motivated this work:

- Equilibrium tides model of Hut 1980 and Hut 1981 (Hut1980_summary)
