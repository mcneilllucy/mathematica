# Mathematica notebooks

Welcome to my Mathematica notebooks page.

The purpose of most notebooks is to reproduce results in theoretical astrophysics peer reviewed papers interactively.

If you have Mathematica software, you can open and run the .nb files. Note that these were made with Mathematica version 13.1.

Otherwise, the calculations can be viewed in the .pdf files.

At the moment, there is

- Equilibrium tides model of Hut 1980 and Hut 1981
- Modelling tidal heating in double white dwarf binaries from McNeill and Hirai [2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21821)
